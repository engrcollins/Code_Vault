Cub Tapestry is built with basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Boostrap, and jQuery. It is a site containing varieties of topics ranging from computational number theories and games to poems and jokes. The purpose of the site is to; practice/implement everything I have learned in web development using basic vanilla JavaScript and also to keep improving on them while the learning continues. Aspiring web developers can learn a lot by studying the source codes via the links provided. Children can as well explore and have fun on the site with some of the site's functionalities - games, poems, jokes e.t.c by merely visiting the site.
I have made the site as simple as possible yet with full functionalities and features. Below are the breakdown of topics and pages in Cub Tapestry:

1.	NUMBER THEORY
A branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and integer-valued functions. 
•	Even and Odd Number
•	Prime Number and Prime Factor
•	Divisibility of Integers
•	Cryptography(Simple Encryption/Decryption)
•	Composite Number
•	Sieve Methods
•	HCF and LCM
•	Parity
•	Factorial
•	Twin Prime, Cousin Prime & Sexy Prime
•	Recurring Decimal
•	Series and Sequence
 
2.	SIMPLE ALGORITHMS
An algorithm is a finite step-by-step well defined sequence of instructions or activities that constitute a process of getting the desired outputs from the given inputs. The raw material(s) needed at the beginning is referred to as input while the rusting entity is referred as output. A search engine uses algorithms. Below is a list of algorithms implemented in this section:
 
•	Count Vowels/Consonants in a String
•	Count Words in a String
•	Eucludean Algorithm
•	Brenford’s Law
•	Binary Search
•	Sorting Algorithm
 

3.	CALCULATORS AND ACCESSORIES
 
•	Simple Calculator
•	BMI Calculator
•	Digital Clock
•	Stop Watch
•	Countdown Timer
•	Alarm Clock
•	Budget Management
•	To-Do List
 

4.	GAMES
 
 

5.	POEMS
•	Not
•	He’s A Real Real Dude

6.	JOKES
•	How To Be A Nerd

7.	NERDS’ CORNER
•	Who Are You?

8.	LIFE HACKS
•	First Principle
